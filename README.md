# PROSTATEx-2
SPIE-AAPM-NCI PROSTATEx Challenges-The PROSTATEx Challenge (" SPIE-AAPM-NCI Prostate MR Classification Challenge‚Äù) focused on  
quantitative image analysis methods for the diagnostic classification of clinically significant prostate cancers and was held 
in conjunction with the 2017 SPIE Medical Imaging Symposium.  PROSTATEx ran from November 21, 2016 to January 15, 2017, though
a "live" version has also been established at https://prostatex.grand-challenge.org  which serves as an ongoing way for
researchers to benchmark their performance for this task.  The PROSTATEx-2 Challenge (" SPIE-AAPM-NCI  Prostate MR Gleason Grade 
Group Challenge" ) was focused on  the development of quantitative multi-parametric MRI biomarkers for the determination of Gleason
Grade Group in prostate cancer.
